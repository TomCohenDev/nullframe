## The Pitch

**For players** who want tactical, crunchy gameplay with cool abilities AND fast-paced narrative play where they have real story authority.

**For GMs** who want easy prep, improvisation-friendly rules, and dramatic conflicts without death spirals or complex math.

**The hook:** Roll dice pools (4-5-6 = success), spend Focus after rolling to push through failures, and use your once-per-session **Narrative Injection** to inject story facts that the GM must honor. Character identity comes from Anchors (skills/competencies) and Burdens (flaws/vulnerabilities), not classes. Play in any setting with modular **Frameworks** that add genre-specific flavor.

## Quick Start

### To Play
1. **Read RULES_SUMMARY.md** — Complete core rules in one file
2. **Choose a Framework** (optional) — Start with `04_frameworks/WYRDWOOD.md` for dark Norse fantasy, or play setting-agnostic
3. **Create characters** — Follow character creation in the rules
4. **Play!**

### To Contribute
1. **Read RULES_SUMMARY.md** — Source of truth for current rules
2. **Check playtest feedback** in `03_playtest/feedback/`
3. **Create or improve Frameworks** — See `04_frameworks/README.md` for guidelines

## Core Design Principles

1. **Tactical Meets Narrative**
   Crunchy dice pools for combat, narrative authority for story direction.

2. **Dice Pools, Not Modifiers**
   Add dice (d6s), count successes (4-5-6), no complex math.

3. **Focus After Rolling**
   Spend Focus AFTER seeing the roll to add successes. No wasted resources.

4. **No Death Spirals**
   Stress track buffers damage. Conditions don't stack. Health ≠ action economy.

5. **Easy GM Prep**
   Single-number NPCs (Level = Difficulty). Improvisation-friendly. Trust the table.

6. **Modular Frameworks**
   Core rules work for any setting. Frameworks add genre-specific flavor, Paths (character options), and special rules.

---

## Frameworks System

**Frameworks** are setting-specific expansions that plug into the core rules. Each Framework includes:
- Setting lore and worldbuilding
- **Paths** - Character progression options (like classes, but flexible)
- Gear and equipment for that setting
- Special rules (magic, technology, etc.)
- Bestiary and NPCs
- GM principles for that genre

### Available Frameworks

**Wyrdwood** (Dark Norse Fantasy) — Complete
- 6 Paths: Drengr (Warrior), Seiðr (Seer), Úlfheðinn (Berserker), Skáld (Bard), Völva (Witch), Outcast (Survivor)
- Grim mythology, psychosis mechanics, realm-crossing, blood oaths
- Inspired by Hellblade, Mörk Borg, Viking Age history

**Coming Soon:**
- Neon Shadows (Cyberpunk)
- Starborne (Space Opera)
- Classic Fantasy
- Post-Apocalyptic
- Superhero

See `04_frameworks/` for details.

## Key Features

### Core Mechanics
- **50% Success Rate:** 4-5-6 on d6 counts as success
- **Focus System:** Shared 0-6 pool, spend AFTER rolling to add successes
- **Anchors & Burdens:** Define your character through competencies and flaws, not classes
- **Narrative Injection:** Once-per-session story authority to inject facts into the narrative
- **Stress Track:** 3-point buffer before taking Conditions

### Character Progression
- **Stats:** Might, Agility, Intellect, Persona (only increase through narrative milestones)
- **Anchors:** Skills/competencies (+1d6 to +3d6), upgrade with Narrative Points (NP)
- **Burdens:** Flaws/vulnerabilities (-1d6 to -3d6), reduce with NP
- **Level ≈ Highest Stat ÷ 2:** Easy power scaling for GMs

### Combat & Conflict
- **Damage = Difficulty - Successes:** Simple, clear calculation
- **NPCs Don't Roll:** Players always roll (attacking or defending)
- **Conditions:** Physical/Mental tracks, only highest applies (no stacking)
- **No Death Spirals:** Getting hurt doesn't reduce your dice pools
